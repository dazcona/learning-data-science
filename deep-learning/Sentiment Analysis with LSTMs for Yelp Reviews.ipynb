       "       u\"I absolutely hate this place. I would give it zero stars if I could. I gave this place a second chance after a awful experience. It was for a bachelorette party, so it wasn't my choice. The food is awful and over priced. I am a food snob and do not hold back when I'm not happy (which is rare!!!) the chicken was dry the potato soup was as thick as cement. The last time I was here I had the chicken and waffle sandwich special. The waffle was hard and crumbly, the chicken was dry and thick. Our drinks weren't refilled and we weren't checked on. We were with a party of 20 WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A PRIORITY. I spoke directly to a manager to get our issues straightened out. He was helpful this time, but was not last time. I will never come back again. So much for a second chance.\",\n",
       "       u\"The first and the last time I will go there. My mom and I used to go to the Sky Nails in Harrison City until a similar issue happened there... Mike was recommended to us by a friend. We both wanted to get our nails dipped, an adhesive is painted onto your nail and that your finger is either dipped into a fine powder or the powder is sprinkled over. We had both gotten it before. Mike told us that he likes to apply the dip powder with a brush because it stays on better. He talked it up like he was doing US a favor. Being that he is the professional, we believed him. It turns out that he used acrylic on our nails rather than dip powder. It is cheaper and quicker to do. He lied to us and over charged us. My nails were $55 and my moms were $45. Her and I both went to get our nails filled at different places yesterday and BOTH technicians asked us where we went prior because what he did was not good for our nails. Applying colored acrylic to the whole nail hinders a technician's ability to see the actual nail so there is no way to know if there is a problem like fungus. Not only did he lie to us and rip us off... I showed him a photo of what I wanted (which offended him because he said he knew what he was doing) my nails looked nothing like the picture! The shape wasn't even close to what I wanted!!! Below is a photo of what I wanted versus what I got.\"], dtype=object)"
